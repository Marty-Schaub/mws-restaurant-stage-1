#Overview
This is a project for the Udacity Front End Devolper Nano Degree. It is a combination of starter code and code that I added to get it to function. The main part added to the starter code by myself is a service worker, responsiveness and accessability. For the responsiveness it includes images that resize as well as the use of flexbox. Both of these were learned throughout the course. For the accessability it is primarily the use of class names and alternatate text on images. 

#Dependencies
To run this you will need to have Python installed so you can run a simple server with it. 

#Installation
You will need to download all of the files and folders in this repository. Once downloaded, in a command prompt navigate to the directory for this project. Type pyhton -m http.server and press enter. This will start a simple HTTP server if you have python installed. If you don't have Python installed and need help installing it or have any other questions or concerns feel free to reach out to me using marty.schaub@gmail.com
